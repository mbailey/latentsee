LatentSee - HTTP Performance Visualizer

latentsee.php downloads a series of files from the webserver and plots response times.

Many web users outside of the US wait too long for pages to load because of site owners choosing cheaper offshore hosting options. I wrote latentsee to investigate the impact of this and was surprised by the results. I decided to make latentsee freely available in the interests of speeding up the web.
