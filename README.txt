LatentSee - HTTP Performance Visualizer

latentsee.php is a tool for measuring the true effect of latency website performance. It downloads a series of files from the webserver and plots response times.

Many web users outside of the US suffer wait too long for pages to load because the site owners choose cheaper offshore hosting options. I wrote latentsee to investigate the impact of this. The results were surprising. I decided to make latensee freely available in the interests of speeding up the web.
